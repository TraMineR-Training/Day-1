Assignment 12. Describe the sequence data you plan to use by specifying:What the sequences are representing and where they come from.In my data I potentially have two sequences I can look at: sequence of IT investments or sequence of contracts.  My data comes from the U.S. Electric Utility Industry.Whether there is one sequence per case or multichannel sequences? In case of multichannel sequences, specify to the following points for each channel.There is one sequence per firm tracked over years (1994-2010).The nature of the sequences (Categorical? Chronological? State or event sequences? ...,)Nature of the sequence could be categorical and chronological.  Contracts are generally state sequences (as they are for a specific time period).  Investments could be either state or event, state because they are usually capitalized over a period of time (duration) or event because they are an investment at a specific time (could provoke a state change).The alphabet (list of symbols in the sequences).Is there a natural order of the symbols (ordinal variable)?AD, IF, LF, OS, RQ, SFno order, these are types of contractshave not as of yet developed alphabet for investment data.Size of the alphabetIf larger than 15, propose category mergings to reduce the size.In case of numerical sequences, suggest a way to discretize the values into 15 classes or less.size of alphabet for contracts is 6.Number of sequences.approximately 300 firms over approx. 17 years.Maximum and minimum sequence lengths.max sequence length would be the max years (17).The kind of knowledge you expect to extract from your sequences. What are you primarily interested in: sequencing, timing, duration, quantum?Most interested in the sequencing, timing, and duration of contract length as they pertain to creating business value for IT investments, we are interested mostly in the sequencing and timing relating to business value as well as comparisons to other firms
